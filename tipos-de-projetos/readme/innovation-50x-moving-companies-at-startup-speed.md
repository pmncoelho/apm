# Innovation 50X - Moving companies at startup speed

now what I thought I'd talked to you about uh for the next hours give you kind of the entire semester in an hourum and we'll see how uh successful we could do that in talking about um howThe Lean Startup kind of now has been U working in corporations how to applylean methodologies that early stage Ventures have uh uh adopted and see how theywould work inside of large companies um how many you from working in or or arein large corporations now how many and how many of you in startups and you're actually sittingnext to each other this should be interesting let's see if you could actually talk to each other as well umbut if you're in a large corporation you know you're being disrupted 247 right now right disruption in Telecom anybodyrecognize one of these right if you're right anybody recognize one of these right um you know disruption happenedliterally in the blink of the eye in video distribution anybody know what this thing was I mean for yeah well nowwe use this thing um you know automobile business you know who ever thought like it's a hundred years takes billions ofdollars no one will ever start an auto company boom right um you know in thespace launch business you know like who's going to build a new rocket company United launch Alliance has notonly the best rocket pockets they got the government in their pocket oopsoops we're being disrupted 247 and companies large corporations arehaving to deal with disruption in a way they never had to before in the 20th century the corporatelife cycle that is from startup to kind of decline to to going out of businesslasted about 60 years 60 years a public company would stay on the New York StockExchange in the 21st century the average is about 20 years and it's declining andyou all kind of read the papers you understand why China is a manufacturer China is aas a customer startups being funded at a scale and and and rate and with dollarsnever imagined before all targeting large corporations and theirmost profitable businesses internet making pricing trans arent internet is a new channel the whole list goes on ofwhat corporate CEOs are and corporate management is faced with in the 21st century in fact the thing I remind mystudents today is all the Jack Welsh rules of the 20th century Everybody Know Jack Welsh right GE great right all theJack Welsh rules of the 20th century if you were to do them now put you out of business in fact with all due respect toany alumni who've taken classes probably 5 years ago or moreeverything you learned about entrepreneurship is probably obsolete so time to go back talk to RichLions I'm sure there's some great exeed programs now they'd be happy to sell youum but the key point is isn't that we were dumb before it's that the world haschanged this is a big idea the world has changed and for most of us you knowparticularly if you have gray here you tend to stick with what you learned in business school or some of those greatmanagement techniques you learned when you went to school here it kind of sticky you still got those Dusty bookson your shelf and you anybody still buy books those are the things dead trees in fact I think now you know the Kindlefolks are are missing a great opportunity because when you buy a digital book it doesn't come with that nice shelf so I think we should sellspines of books don't you think and so isn't that a new opportunity for some entrepreneur it turns out for largecompanies your competitor's speed is a threat their speed in technology theirspeed in using new channels your enemy is time and the way large companies canmitigate that is by continuous innovation by adapt adaptability andusing some Lean Startup principles that we'll talk about in a second but I would want to remind everybody Silicon Valleyhas been operating at speed for 50 years we've been doing speed urgencythrough desperation for 5050 years but not just speed urgency and Technologywe've actually figured out how to innovate with speed and urgency and Ibelieve companies can do this as well and therefore the purpose of this talk uh this morning so one of the thingsthat's kind of interesting um I I uh for those you don't know the how many of youhave heard about the Lean Startup methodology any of you oh okay um uh andthose of you who haven't just ask the person next to you um um as hos alumni by the way for those ofyou who've heard of lean it started about 50 feet from here I taught thefirst lean Innovation class called customer development here at hos 12years ago in fact the first ideas about lean methodologies um happened uh when Iretired in 1999 I had done eight startups in 21 years I had uh four IPOs but what generatedlean was nothing about those successes it was actually I had two craters so with two failures so so bad they leftcraters so deep they have their own aridium layer that's um um and and in fact um my next to last startup um I wason the cover of Wired Magazine and as I was looking at the cover um I realized Iwas going out of business and 90 days later I did um and so I called my mother who was a Russianimmigrant English wasn't her first language still after a long time in the country so every time I talked to my momI know I have to pause as she translated in her head um and so I called her upand said um mom um you know I'm just calling you to tell you I lost $35million pause translate and she said logically where'd you putit I I I I I I said no no no I I lost itlike spent it it's gone you know it's like and pause longer pause and then shesaid oh my God the country we came from is gone we there's nowhere else for us to go and then she thought even more andsaid and her name is blank we can't even change it um and so a ton of those lessons endedup in the Lean Startup methodology which I'll share with you in a second but now back to large companies it turns outabout 20 or 30 years ago McKenzie anybody heard of Mackenzie any McKenzie folks in the room any Mackenzie folks inthe room you should be proud of this one um bagy coli and white came up with this idea 20 or plus years ago that said lookthe way to think about innovation in large corporations is let's put them in buckets three Horizons of innovationthat is let's just characterize How We Do innovation in three Horizons Horizon oneis kind of our mature businesses Horizon 2 are our rapidly growing businesses andVerizon 3 are emerging businesses now I looked at this and said how do we updatethis for the 21st century well it Dawns on me that those three Horizons ofinnovation which is a great way to start talking about Innovation large companies is to find whether your business modelis being executed extended or searched for explored so execution it's a knownbusiness model by the way a business model is basically all the parts of commercialization that creates value forfor your customers and your company you need to know who the customers are what the value proposition is what productMarket fit is what's the right channel what's the right pricing what activities you need to do that is all thosecomponents make up a business model you could also extend the businessmodel or you could have an unknown one in search for them and what I found is if we startoverlaying what we know about a business model onto McKenzie's three Horizon we get something kind of interestingthat is Horizon 1 really is the existing business or Mission model this typicallyis process Innovation inside of a large corporation you're adding more features you're making the supply chainmore efficient you're changing pricing you're making competitive movesin Horizon 2 your business model is kind of known but you're extending it what'san extension of a business model I'm going to add an additional Channel I'm going online or I might be targeting adifferent customer segment with the same product or I understand a customer segment perfectly well but I'm Proctorand Gamble I have this huge manufacturing and research group let me come up with a Swiffer a whole newproduct category but existing business model existing Channel etc those are Horizon 2 Innovations but Horizon 3Innovations are disruptive you know nothing about the business model what's a great example well from TechAmazon web services from this book company what the heck does this turns out it's one of the most profitable ifyou've seen the numbers for Amazon uh they are basically the Computing utility for theworld or the canonical version in Silicon Valley is Apple and the iPhonewhat on Earth did Apple know about first the iPod and then the iPhone what did they know about those businesses almostnothing pure disruption inside those large companies sofor me these three Horizons startus to begin to have a conversation about types of innovation in largecorporations and I want to emphasize that the distinction between Horizon 1and Horizon 3 is the distinction between searching for a business model andexecuting a business model large corporations are built around executionof known business models it's a big idea you know who your customers are youknow who your channel is you know pricing you know competitors you knoweverything at least this week you do but in astartup startup you really don't know anything and in a disruptive ornew opportunity inside a large corporation you also don't know anythingnow by the way if I'm looking at this from the perspective of a large company your capabilities and riskassessment differ in Horizon one this is my existing business it's my existingcapabilities I have all these skills I have a great Salesforce have great manufacturing wonderful engineering lowrisk to do product line extensions here you know if I want to get into a newchannel or new products for existing customers there's moderate risk but Horizon 3 wellthese are crazy bets and that's a big idea because when you do a horizon one bet you have prettyclose to certainty that that's going to be successful and you just need to make onebet but in Horizon 3 mistakes large companies make is treating them likeHorizon one bets you know after 50 years of venture capital VCS don't invest inone company per font they invest in aportfolio and therefore Horizon 3 bets in existing corporations also need to beInnovation portfolios rather than single Innovation bets make sense um the other thing is how do youin a large corporation allocate across the Horizons in terms of dollars now this differs perindustry but in the tech industry Innovation allocation kind of looks something like this 60 to 70% ofdollars spent on Horizon 1 20 to 30% Horizon 2 and depending on yourcorporation you're making small but important bets in Horizon 3 the other thing to think about iswhat's the return on investment by Horizon and this one almost always kindof messes up large corporations hey we got it let's go you know do do disruptive stuff let's put our money onthis and we'll see returns in the next quarter well you know you're lucky inHorizon 1 you could get some rois within a year or two and you do that by improving or partnering or acquiringHorizon 2 you could extend that model but the ROI ROI is longer and Horizon 3though if you're doing these internally these are long-term betsand again iPhone Amazon web services Etc are great examples of internal R\&D thattook a while now obviously you could shortcut this in a large corporation byacquiring disruption but you need to understand that the ROI for Horizon 3 is not goingto appear for the next quarter make sense now what's really interesting isto build Horizon one organizations we become experts at Key performanceindicators we have HR manuals we have legal guides we Finance could tell youyou know down to the quarter in fact we have fiveyear forecasts planning Horizons strategy groups and by the wayyou know we kind of incent our employees with promotions and bonuses and so following process and procedure inHorizon 1 is all about execution and if you do it correctly at least for a whileit equals profit so you would think okay I got itHorizon 3 it's just a smaller version of horizon 1 well it turns out in Horizon 3initiatives that equals Death you use the same process and procedure andpersonnel and financial metrics and legal and find and branding andwhatever you've just killed your your Innovation initiatives you strangled them in its cribHorizon 3 does something very different they're searching for product Market fitthey're doing pivots they're trying to be agile and they're taking risk on a scale that will rattle your cfo'steeth and at the end there's a large reward but most oftenfailure now what's really interesting is how do you keep both inside a largecompany and this is what's kind of gotten us screwed up for 50 years is trying to doInnovation as a permanent process rather than an exception inside of largecorporations so disruptive corporate Ventures Horizon 3 and startups share the samecharacteristics it's a big idea startups and Horizon 3 initiativesin large companies are identical whoa well that's interestingbecause what have we learned in the last couple years so Horizon 3 operates withurgency it's not burdened by existing customers Channel or inventory just likea startup it has its own processes procedures and kpis and everybody'sfocused on a single mission and survival this is a spec of astartup now what's really interesting is defining what a company versus a startupis companies are a permanent organization designed to to execute arepeatable and scalable process right you've already in the early days of the company found a repeatable businessmodel and now you've built the Machinery to execute it how do you know do youhave kpis yep do you have job descriptions yep do you have a sales planyep does the street Wall Street understand what your you know earnings per share should be yep okay you have arepeatable and scalable execution machine of course you could grew it up but you know what it's supposed to looklike in contrast and here's what we never understood is that startups are atemporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalablebusiness model this distinction between search and execution was articulated for the firsttime here at H this is the basis of what the Lean Startupis because we had spent a 100 years in business school developing strategies and tacticsand organizational theory for execution of a business model why well what doesthe word MBA or acronym MBA mean master of BusinessAdministration big idea no no big idea it's not a pajor of mba'smade the American Century of innovation and execution but it was designed to giveyou tools to execute a known business model the light bulb we had here at hoswas we didn't really have too many tools to search for business models and itwasn't that other people weren't thinking about that we needed them it's a whole history of corporate Innovationbut where I came from was asking do we have any tools forstartups to for business models and the answer was not really and so the LeanStartup was our attempt to build a management tool set that paralleled thetool set for execution make sense and so startups are R the lean and let me giveyou my summary of what the Lean Startup methodology is and then we'll tie it back into how it would work inside alarge company the lean method the lean methodology is essentially as I said trying build amanagement stack a tool set for searching for business models and at theend because we collect a lot of data it actually gives us evidence-based entrepreneurship it actually turnsentrepreneurship into something with discipline and rigor rather than GE we're allowed to bring our dogs to workand have free food and you know whatever um which used to be what I used to think it it was allabout lean has three parts part one sayslook what we do in existing companies when we have a series of knowns we couldwrite a business plan and we could write a five-year forecast why because we knowour business we know our competitors we know our Channel we know our you know everything else but in a startup we really don'tknow any of that stuff and in fact first derivative of not knowing all that stuffmeans in a startup no business plan survives first contact with customers it's a big idea and in factwhat Silicon Valley investors did for the first 50 years is tell startups is nah no nah you're nothing moreimplicitly you're nothing more than a smaller version of a large company so large companies write plans we want youto write a plan large companies write five-year forecast we want you to write fiveyear forecasts and large companiesdo alpha beta you know first customer ship and then you know have the bags money come in you make sure your officeis big enough so you could have those bags of money coming in and yet we never seem to be surprisedthat 90% of those startups would fail well obviously it was all about the people couldn't have been about theplan well now we realize is that the only people to require five-year plans on a series ofcomplete unknowns fiveyear plans and a series of complete unknowns here get ready forthis one is the Soviet Union and Venturecapitals and and therefore when I woke up I said am I the only one to kind oflike and it turns out I was um and this was the core of because we had no otherlanguage or tools to describe business plans are great for situations whereyou're executing a series of known but here we're describing a series of UNknown so what should we use here and the answer was we don't even know so that's what the lean methodology is all aboutlean methodology starts with a very different assumption since you don't have any knowns you have a series ofunknowns and because at H you pay a lot of money to go to school we call thoseunknowns hypothesis but outside of H we call themgases and the way we artic ated all those guesses is we used something called thebusiness model canvas designed by a guy named Alexander osterwalder and so thefirst part of lean is simply a single diagram one page that articulates for anew Venture about 80% of all the things you need to know about commercializationthat on day one are just effing guesses I'll let you fill in what the effing isum meaning you don't really know who your customers are you have an opinion you really don't know what your valueproposition is which is a fancy business school word for what product or service you're building and you're guessingabout your Revenue model and you're definitely guessing about your costs umat least for the students whose plans I look at um um so part one we make you write allthis stuff down in little yellow sticky notes no plan because the second part isby the way this is how you create and deliver value for the company and customers we're going to use this toframe the hypothesis and step two in the lean is the part I invented and and bythe way these are all the questions you ask and there's a whole book on this ostar wer wrote too business modelgeneration and the second one there value proposition design you should have them on your shelf or at least pretendyou read them um and since they're all pictures it's actually great versus mybooks which are T texts um but these are the questions you kind of ask ask butthe second part is the part I invented as Rich mentioned here at H I realizedthere are no facts inside your building so get the hell outside that is we usedto operate and I did this in multiple startups and I see large companies doing this all the time for new Ventures ismaybe if we talk to each other enough we could somehow figure out what customers needs and wantsbut we now know there is no possible way that sitting in the room conference roomlaboratory Etc then you could be smarter than the collective intelligence of your potential customers it's a big idea andthe customer Discovery methodology simply says we're going to take all those hypotheses every one of thesetreat them as hypotheses and now as we're building we're going to get out ofthe building and start searching for the truth behind those hypotheses we'regoing to try to validate or invalidate or refine those hypothesis with a formal methodology called customer developmentit's how we turn the business model into facts and we're going to do this at speed and I'll show you what speed lookslike in a second so we're going to turn these guesses into facts and we're going to do this in a way that not onlyappeals to business people but blow scientists and Engineers out of theirsocks the reason why is the customer Discovery and development methodologyhas been done for the last 500 years it's the scientificmethod it's why the National Science Foundation adopted this class as thebasis of commercialization of all science in the United States which I'll show you in a second but basically itsays hey we have a hypothesis could be about a customer about a Channel about pricing let's design anexperiment let's run that experiment get the data derive some insight andvalidate invalidate or modify the hypothesis how hard is that well we never used to do that inbusiness school we just kind of assumed that since we had a something we wrote down in our plan and it was formattedcorrectly and we had the right sections according to our business schoal professor then therefore all we neededto do was execute the plan by the way the Third thir part of Lan only three parts is we're going tobuild the product differently than we did in the 20th century my first studentEric ree who I'll admit it now 12 years later actually snuck into the classum was the first one to maybe we could send him his check for tuition now umcame up with this observation that says Steve people in the 21st century are nolonger Building Products in a ser IAL basis which is called waterfall right we spec the product then we go intodevelopment then we go to Alpha test beta test first customer ship in the 21st century we kind of now realize wecould build products Hardware software even drugs or even anything else incrementally anditeratively and that's called agile Engineering in contrast to Waterfall which is a Serial process and so thethird part of lean is we're going to build the products incrementally and iteratively getting feedback with waybefore we would normally ship the product and that allows us to build something called the minimum viableproduct this phrase MVP is the smallest feature set that gets us the mostlearning remember those hypothesis you might have a minimum viable product to figure out who your customers are youmight have a another one very different to test pricing might just be a fake price list might be another one to justtest feature set it's not a prototype and it's not a Deployable version It'swhat enables a test of a hypothesis could be a drawing a wireframe a clickable workflow Etc the other keyidea about lean which is not intuitively obvious is something called thepivot a let me explain something um that I used to livethrough in a startup in the 20th century here's how startups worked you know enenthusiasm slide deck plan that no one read getfunded lock down engineering throw in Sugar you know caffeine you knowwaterfall development Alpha test beta test first customer ship press launch more press first boardmeeting everyone's high-fiving the VP marketing you got some great press we used to get press on dead trees put inkon them everybody was happy no one would be looking at the VP of sales first meeting next board meetingboard meeting Silicon Valley still think it's the same about every six weeks someone would finallyturn to the VPS sales and pull out that fiveyear revenue forecast that was in the business plan and say how we'redoing and she'd say oh back then excuse me he'd say because that was 20thcentury um he'd a great pipelinenow only do I get Applause in a business school because you all know what that means when I say this in the engineering school they go what what's a ppipeline all right so so great Pipeline and that by the way every six weeks thatconversation reoccurs how we doing oh little Revenue we're not making the plan but pipeline going to be great all thethe orders were deferred to the next quarter or hurricane so and so hit or what yes but that was in Bangladesh whatwhat did that happen didn't matter now by the way you know as the only numberwe're actually making while this is going on is the expense line now depending on the economicclimate your VC's let this go and if it's a bubble actually when you need to raise money your valuation goes up itdoesn't matter um or you sell it to a hedge fund nowadays I mean it doesn't matter um but in the old days youactually cared and finally one day you'd open the boardroom door and no one's sitting next to the VP of sales in factthe stench of death is in the room and the minute he says pipeline poof ashesand a new VPS salale shows up and says what a stupid strategy that was Boy whatan idiot and everybody agrees and the VCS say yeah what's the new strategy and they come up with new strategy thiscontinues another nine months until sales still isn't making the numbers guess who gets it next anybodyknow no VP marketing of course must be a positioning problem you just hired the V new vpa sales poof new vpamarke new vpa marketing comes in and says dumb marketing strategy VC's agreedmust must have been a marketing Str but this continues then you finally fire the the founder who becomes the You KnowChief technical officer blah blah blah does anybody understand what wewere doing when we fired that executive what were wedoing besides blaming it was the only time our investors gave us permission tochange strategy that is the whole history for the first 50 years of startups said wenever once questioned the plan we assumed that the assumptions in the plan were correct why because theVC's funded it they couldn't have been wrong they're not going to be fired you're going to be fired it must havebeen no there was nothing wrong with are assumptions about who the customers were whether we got product Market fit rightor wrong whether we had the right Channel or whatever no no let's blame it on the individual sales just isn't goodenough now obviously that might be the case but we never once questionedwhether our fundamental assumptions about everything about the hypotheses we had we never called them hypothesisbecause the minute we took money from an investor that quote plan all those assumptions now became concrete factsisn't that kind of crazy this word pivot now gives us permission to fire the planrather than Executives first a pivot is a substantive change to one or more ofthose business model canvas components we assume in a Lean Startup model bigidea we assume that on day one because all we have our hypotheses aboutcustomers and products and channels and pricing and whatever that most of them are going to be wrong and so we'reactively learning changing and refining until wefinally find product Market fit and think we have a repeatable model it gives us iteration without crisis andwhat what allows startups to look like a blur to large corporations allows us tobe fast agile and opportunistic we could do this in weeks and months for $100,000and the cycle time of how fast we do this minimizes cash needs U so elementsof Lean Startup again business model canvas customer development agile engineering pretty simple right uh bythe way lean got Theory um as I said first class was held here ever firsttime words lean customer development agile engineering ever appeared was literally across the hall across thehall here at H uh I wrote a book turns out was my class notes uh on customer uhdevelopment which kicked off The Lean Startup movement called four steps The Epiphany Alexander osterwalder wrote thehis book on the business model canvas Eric ree uh finally put everything helearned down in something called The Lean Startup um as I said added the idea of agile engineering and uh all thisbecame the cover of the Harvard Business review on May 2013 if you want to see probably the best summary of what leanis just go take a look at that lean gets practice as I said um the first classwas taught here and then became something called a Lean LaunchPad class at a lesser school down southand and why I mentioned that lesser school is all those components came together here I was teaching lean theoryin cases and in this other school I was teaching in the engineering school whosestudents actually wanted to build real products and so we kind of reconfigured the class into that they had to apply asteams actually coming in with real product ideas and what happened is um somethinginteresting I blogged every week of the that class and I got a call drivingaround campus that kind of went like this uh is this Steve blank yes uh hiI'm AOL aralik from the National Science Foundation the US government needs your help and because I'm somewhat of a jerkbecause people will tell you certainly my students will um I I said well the US government got my help during Vietnamfor four years you're not getting it again he he said no I'm from thenational Science Foundation I said what's the National Science Foundation and like he see Errol and I still joketoday he said I should have hung up right then but instead the National ScienceFoundation took the class developed here in the school down south and made itinto the it's the exact class it's now called the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps if you want an NSF sbiror sttr Grant you take some form of this class now and and I put the lecturesonline there are now a quarter million students who have watched it on Udacity and by the way the nsfi corps has justpassed 800 teams of principal investigators and their grad students the best of our scientists and engineersin the US have gone through this program uh the NIH National Institute of Healthadopted it in 2014 I prototyped a version of the class for Therapeuticsdevices uh Diagnostics and digital Health that UCSF and then we ran thisclass at NIH um elements of the dod adopted it and U we're doing a newversion um again for National Security called hacking for defense but there have been variance of this for almostevery um industry you could imagine so let me give you an example of how does this really work and then tie it backinto corporate Innovation so here's a an example of a student team's finalpresentation at hos this January and by the way we don't do a demo day we do aLessons Learned day that is our final presentation um I hate demo days demodays to me is simply uh entrepreneurs and bikinis in front of investorsum think think about that image and that should gross you out as well CU justjust makes right you want to take a shower after that but but but truly ifyou think about a demo day if you're an investor in the back of the room is here's how smart I am right now and bythe way isn't my font great and haven't I learned how to project well it tells you nothing aboutwhat did you learn what's your velocity and trajectory and where did you get your evidence that like you actually know anything well you're going to haveto believe my slide that always looks like this and my competitors are on the bottom you know left and I'm on the topright and by the way you know since you're all hos graduates you can knock out one of those presentations in theweekend but there's no facts behind them and so let me show you what a fact-basedevidence-based output of a Lean LaunchPad class looks like so this was a team calledwiser in 10 weeks at hos they spoke to 114 eyeball to eyeball customers this isnot Survey Monkey this is not email Etc umbasically I believe you haven't done customer Discovery if you haven't seen someone's pupils dilate and the only wayyou could do that is either in person or or with high quality Skype or or video um and here was the team and they cameup with a initial business model canvas what they wanted to do is uh basicallysell to hospitals a way to reduce infections by having a high quality kindof hand cleaning and washing for doctors and nurses uh to reduce the risk in ofinfection and you can see kind of this is a summary of their initial business model canvas you could see what weakthis is on the bottom of the slides um basically they learned very quickly thattheir business wasn't the hand sanitizers their business really was providing accurate data um to thehospitals that was a real big idea they thought they were making hand sanitizers but gee the hospitals say we could buyanybody's hand sanitizers we just don't have any data about who's using it because um you know that's how we get inhospitals get funded to get our money back um so they basically removed thenotion of the save time through easy access to hand sanitizers is one of the key value propositions and they try tounderstand who are the customers in the hospital and they said well day one that was pretty easy the customers are goingto be you know the people use this and very quickly as after they talked to 115customers uh they've realized that no there are multiple customer segments there's the hospital mow medicalcommittee there's inpac and Hospital quality control directors there's Hospital materials and finance managersit directors and then finally the doctors and nurses and Crews who need to be washing their hands and these allkind of interrelate they had no idea about this on day one this is week five and by the way they made customerarchetypes for each one of those customer segments they knew none of this on day one um and then they try tofigure out am I in a new market that is this Market never exist or am I in an existing Market there anew market might be this is some kind of wearable thing where I'm collecting data everybody's wearing Badges and I couldfigure out when they have kind of washed their hands or is this an existing Market I'm a compliance data providerand so they were trying to understand what business are they in and they started by thinking they were making asanitizer dispenser CH chamber and this was a product driven company until theyrealized that no they're in an existing business which is compliance data collection the other thing they neededto understand is what's their distribution channel in week six they got out and tried to figure out how did they sell is it through ConsultantsDistributors will they have a direct Salesforce and they try to figure out what their sales funel will look like onthe left how do they get customers how will they keep them and how will they grow them again trying to understandcustomer acquisition cost how many hospital visits can a salesman make how many hours spent per Hospital what's thecost how much is a hospital visit going to cost how much pilot Hardware would cost Etc and actually try to quantifycustomer acquisition cost way before they ever launched the product and then who else are the competitors anybodyelse doing this or were they just Geniuses who you know figured out Hospital compliance of course the thingwe ask all the teams if there are trade shows get your butt out to them because you will figure out more about compcompetitive analysis walk in the halls of a show than you will on on the web and they came back kind of Shell Shockedrealizing oops you know hey we weren't the first people that somebody's laughing because they were proba in thisbusiness um that there's more competitors than we thought I could almost write that line for every team Imean you know which is good and bad and now by week eight they're trying tounderstand the left side of the canvas what activities do they need to become expert in and they discover anotherbasic principle don't reinvent the wheel to get to Market quickly so you know do they need to do R\&D for Hardware sensorsand wearables or do they need to focus on data and insights and again the more they kept talking to the to thehospitals they were realizing everybody's providing that you know Hardware no one's giving them data and insights and so they decided to useexisting Hardware vendors but actually to add value by building a minimum viable product for a whole system thatthey could provide a data interface for quality control directors and hospitalsso it went from a hardware we make hand sanitizers to Holy Cow we providinghighquality data for quality control directors who would pay anything big word we'll pay anything this is when yougo liquidity event um andso what they realized is hospitals are a business and decisions are driven by p\&land hand hygiene is just one component of a clinical workflow so um in themiddle of the class they got a green light by the John mura Medical Center umfor actually triing the product and they're going to start building working prototypes by the way 10 weeks 10 weeksfor those of you large companies hold this thought 10 weeks let me show you avery different example same methodology uh we using this methodology to now solve national security problemsuh and we're going to scale this by the way to as many universities as we canmuch like we did the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps I have the intent to create the equivalent ofNational Technical Roc in the 21st century with this class let me show youand this is called hacking for defense um week one here was a team um thatbasically was working on someone else's problem that is the the difference in this class same lean methodology exceptwe use problem sets given to us from the dod and intelligence community and thisproblem set was to solve problems um related to Isis messaginghow in fact do we understand uh Target and then um disrupt messaging fromadversaries like Isis and so the week week one the team came in and the teams by the way when you take this version ofthe class you show up on day one having already spoken to 10 customers or stateakeh holders and within 5 minutes of the class you're standing and presenting your initial business model canvas andyour results uh there is no intro I am Dave I'm computer science I am Sallythat's that's nice do that on your time on my time we're hitting the groundand so they came in with already thinking about here's our minimum viable product here's our customer Discoveryhere's and and in um hacking for defense instead of the business model canvas it's a mission model canvas that isthere's no revenue for the dod but there's what do you want to achieve and there's no Channel but there'sdeployment but the rest of the canvas is almost identical you could recognize it and here was who they thought their umvalue proposition canvas the kind of a blow up between the product on the left and the customer segment on the rightlet me fast forward to week five this is in the middle of the class same team nowall of a sudden they went in and tried to understand their customer in detail uh this is now the Army's AR cyberactually this is the entire us government's an counter cyber group whenArc cyber saw this or chart they said uh excuse us uh can we use this orgchart turns out this is now being used in the US Army as the orchart and then and since this week so every week we March the teams through each part of the business model canvasthis was the week figuring out how to get this deployed that is much like in large companies the dod Department ofDefense sees a billion demos I don't care about having this class create demos I want them to figure out how doyou get stuff really deployed inside the Department of Defense or inside a large corporation so this week they weretrying to figure out how do you get funded and actually cut through the entire acquisition and procurementprocess which anybody have ever seen the Department of Defense diagram of that it's about 400 pages long um it turnsout they discovered there's a secret way to get funded called other transactional authorities which allows you to getfunded literally in 90 days 90 days uh and so they discovered what OTAs are andthis one might look kind of a little complicated but when the Army told theseguys we want you to solve the uh you know Isis social messaging problem that was literally their description wellfive weeks into the class they realized there wasn't a social messaging problem there were multiple problems and that noone had actually put him on a graph saying which problem do you want us to solve this is now thesecond Slide the Army's Now using because they had no idea what the problem was and the lean methodology bythe way they're now they didn't just come up with this in thin air they've talked to already in week five67 users stakeholders beneficiaries program managers War Fighters analystsEtc to get here and they've continued to go through their customer discovery they came up with um some potentialsolutions to the problem here were some narratives to the problem here was their updated Mission model canvas and nowthey have details on every possible user here's H what the operator analyst caresabout here's what the U uh people on op plans care about here's what some moreum analysts care about here's what the major and Lieutenant Colonel think about it the decision makers and by the wayyou could also use the same tool set for social media and political campaigns kind of interesting or inmarketing Etc does this make sense about tactically how you do this good so nowlet me tell you how this works in companies by the way as you could tell lean means getting out of the buildingum so the problem is most attempts at lean in the last three to five years incorporations end up as what I call Innovation theater and by Innovation theater is you know large companies havenow kind of looked at startups and said let's use some of their methodologies and and I've startedgetting called in in the last year or so because CEOs have now noticed well weset up the corporate incubator and we have great posters and great coffee cups um and it's a nice building and we'vegotten some great press releases but we didn't move the needle top line or bottom line but greattheater how do we really use lean to make change so um let me tell you aworld class example of what happened about 40 years ago when aultimate Horizon 3 Innovation met a horizon 1 process and procedure and giveyou a feeling of what it what the problem is so this was a horizon 3project we landed men on the moon within eight years of saying let's do it whenwe had no idea how to do it where to do it Etc three astronauts traveled to quartmillion miles spent a week in a little capsule came back home Pinnacle ofinnovation and when they came back home this Horizon 3 project met Horizon 1management this is actually Buzz aldrin's Customsform I swear it's on his website you can findit Customs forms where'd you go Cape Kennedy moon on theleft Honolulu anything to declare uh Moon Rock Moon dustsamples okay y i i could see that and they had a sign it you could see it signed and then you would think they'redone but no no had to fill out the expensereport where'd you go well I was in my house house um then I went to EdwardsAir Force Base and then to Cape Kennedy and then from July 19th through the 21stI was at the Moon then I was floating in the Pacific Ocean until you guys picked me up then Iwent to Hawaii back to Edwards and now I'm in this damn van for 30 days in isolation where do you think I've beennow of course Aldren put this up cuz he was pissed he wanted to be paid per mile and they paid him per DM\[Applause] so so let me explain this to me kind oflike you know if there was ever a case of horizon 3 and Horizon 1 like not talking to each other what happens herewell in startups and more importantly in new corporate initiatives Innovation starts and it has to start with norestrictions on plans processes or procedures and success means whetherit's a startup or Corporation finding a repeatable and scalable business model right I've been talking about that a lotand it grows and scales one of the things we now know about large corporations and Innovationif you use the Horizon model just as a mental map you cannot start a horizon 3initiative in its own in the same building as Horizon 1 just your normalhuman nature it's not a lot of physics but gee I need some extra budget there are these guys are I got this emergencyin Horizon 1 take the best people in Horizon 3 GE we're running out money let's shut down the Horizon 3 can't dothat it has to be physically separated with their own plans procedures policies initiatives and kpis and allows them tooperate with speed urgency um remember goal is for Horizon 3 to find a repeatable and scalablebusiness or Mission model and a success path for Horizon 3 is there are threechoices either gets so large so quickly think of Android at at Google that itbecomes a new Vision by itself or it'sreally growing but you know what it doesn't fit our Core Business we can't find a home for it no division wants itlet's spin it out or more than often happens is this is pretty interesting itreally belongs in an existing division let's spin it in and let me take the spin in case because this one has arepeatable set of looks like a car crash almost everytime now turns out that when you build a horizon 3 organization whether it's astartup or a large company you create technical shortcuts called technicaldebt anybody ever hear of this term right the people raising their hand they're probably in startups righttechnical debt is everything you dothat if your engineering school Professor had seen it or your business SCH they'd hang you meaning it's everypossible shortcut because you're just urgently trying get something out and working but eventually when the productbecomes successful that like jury rig spaghetti code doesn't scale and so yougot to clean it up and that cleaning up is called refactoring make sense just aspecial word for clean up the mess you had technically in Silicon Valley Technical debt is a knownword but what we really never understood particularly about large corporationswhich explains a lot when you start a horizon 3 group that actually has nowbecome successful you've also created organizational debt organizational debtsays those same people who created that new crazy division there's no effing wayyou want them to run anything large right because they'll break everythingand by the way it's okay but you need to acknowledge that you've created organizational debt thatneeds to be cleaned up if you want to spin this thing in if you don't want to spin it in then for God's sake spin itout or start a new Division and the part that we missed and we still miss inevery large corporation is this debt part is natural whatwhat we still get wrong is trying to spin in a horizon 3 group into anexisting Horizon one organization without doing refactoring of the technology and the peopleand we need a separate small group to do that a refactoring group very fewcompanies have had this light bulb a refactoring group are actually people who like to take buggy unfinished codeand love to take you know spaghetti and actually get it into the common standards and quality and whatever yourcompany requires to make it part of the standard product does that make sense this is notaccept ception every time I talk to a large company they go oh yes that's we must be the only company that runs intothis and the joke is every company go runs into this but no one realizes this literally is only five or 10 people in aa thousand or 10,000 person Division and almost no company has it you need a a process organizationdedicated to refactoring um the goal is to actually have this as a continual Loop not as aone-time event so scale now requires processes and procedures and incentives and kpi and Innovation if it's spun innow becomes execution now what's really interesting though is those innovatorsin Horizon 3 the worst thing you could do is now put them inside that Horizon 1organization unless you're actually want them to leave your company because what you want is acontinuous cycle the founders of a startup and or early employees of ahorizon 3 organization don't fit into execution organizations and in short-sighted companies they leave infar-sighted companies you let them start the next cycle of innovation make sensethe third part is when you have these Horizon 3 Standalone groups well cuzyou're a large company if you're smart they're not just quite standing aloneyou want to task all the support organizations Finance legal HR Etc towork inside those organizations but not to get them to conform to the Horizon 1processes but to get the Horizon 1 organizations to agree to yes I'll giveyou an example we prototyped something like this Eric Reese now runs programcalled Fast works at GE but I prototyped the first fast Works group U what became fast works in the transportationdivision at GE Jeff elil gave uh this 13-year executive permission togo start a Innovative group okay I got permission from the CEO so he starts Staffing thegroup and he gets call from HR you can't take those people they're not the mostsenior now I hope all of you are laughing not just some of you right so all of a sudden we got an immediatedisconnect that the Horizon 1 rules were trying to be applied to Horizon 3 does that make sense you really want it towork backwards The Horizon 3 folks get to write their own rules the way we make it make it work and the Horizon 1 folksonly get to veto veto them if they put the company at risk and we have a very quick committee decision process todecide that within uh Seven Days Seven working days we decide whether that thatnew rule puts the company at risk but basically you want to get to yes and you want to leverage the existing assets notjust have it as a startup but actually use the power of your channel your manufacturing Etc everybody needs to buyinto this process and the other piece is when I get called in by largecorporations saying Steve our you know essentially our Horizon 3 stuff isn't working first question I asked the CEOis so what's your incentive and bonus program for having Horizon 3 projectswell I don't have any um how about your board well they don't have any well how about your exec staff well the guy whoruns our incubator well you know unless um you're incenting the Mavericks butalso incenting support and adoption it ain't going to happen um and if they noHorizon 2 and three incentives in the company then there's no real commitment to Innovation and positive could beFinancial Awards negative could be you lose some funding for your existing projectsum so the goal is to have a continuous circle of innovation in a largecorporation success means scale scale requires kpis and Innovation becomesexecution and remember what Horizon 3 is running here is the lean methodology Bidea so why I showed you all that lean stuff we're not talking about spending years figuring out whether there's anopportunity you could do that in months in fact the most public version of ofthis methodology being run in a large corporation is WL Gore gorex folks um are now shipping some of the first um uhsamples of of their output of their lean Horizon 3 activities I'm going to wrapup in a two minutes um so it turns out um doing entrepreneurshipin a large corporation sometimes looks like a Dilbert cartoon um in fact it canbe uh but it turns out entrepreneurs need to know what the rules are so itturns out there's a way to be a bad Rebel and a way to be a good rebel inside a large corporation and a womannamed Carmen marada wrote a great book I hand out by the case to large organizations and the government calledRebels at work and if you don't have it you should uh it's a quick read but actually this is the most famous slidefrom her book just as an a side Horizon 3 protects Mavericks Horizon 1 firesthem in Horizon 1 Mavericks entrepreneurs are pains in the butt they're looking to do something different they don't get with theprogram in Horizon 3 they're the head of your Innovation project and they invent your next capability so with that um ifyou want to figure out how to actually do this you can take my next class um but I'll I'll wrap up here and saythank you very much and thanks for listening
