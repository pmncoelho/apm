OKRs. Short for Objectives and Key Results. It is a collaborative goal-setting protocol for companies, teams, and individuals.They cannot substitute for sound judgment, strong leadership, or a creative workplace culture. But if those fundamentals are in place, OKRs can guide you to the mountaintop.

An OBJECTIVE, I explained, is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking—and fuzzy execution.

KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable.

First, said Edwin Locke, “hard goals” drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals “produce a higher level of output” than vaguely worded ones.

> how do you build engagement? A two-year Deloitte study found that no single factor has more impact than “clearly defined goals that are written down and shared freely. . . . Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction.”

A decisive ingredient for OKR success: conviction and buy-in at the top

They clarify expectations: What do we need to get done (and fast), and who’s working on it? They keep employees aligned, vertically and horizontally

As you will see in the pages to come, objectives and key results drive clarity, accountability, and the uninhibited pursuit of greatness.

Then come the four OKR “superpowers”: focus, align, track, and stretch.,

> Superpower #1—Focus and Commit to Priorities (chapters 4, 5, and 6): High-performance organizations home in on work that’s important, and are equally clear on what doesn’t matter. OKRs impel leaders to make hard choices. They ’re a precision communication tool for depart
>
> Superpower #2—Align and Connect for Teamwork (chapters 7, 8, and 9): With OKR transparency, everyone’s goals—from the CEO down—are openly shared. Individuals link their objectives to the company ’s game plan, identify cross-dependencies, and coordinate with other teams. By connecting each contributor to the organization’s success, top-down alignment brings meaning to work. By deepening people’s sense of ownership, bottom-up OKRs foster engagement and innovation.
>
> Superpower #3—Track for Accountability (chapters 10 and 11): OKRs are driven by data. They are animated by periodic check-ins, objective grading, and continuous reassessment—all in a spirit of no-judgment accountability. An endangered key result triggers action to get it back on track, or to revise or replace it if warranted.
>
> Superpower #4—Stretch for Amazing (chapters 12, 13, and 14): OKRs motivate us to excel by doing more than we’d thought possible. By testing our limits and affording the freedom to fail, they release our most creative, ambitious selves.

Part Two covers OKRs’ applications and implications for the new world of work:

> CFRs (chapters 15 and 16): The failings of annual performance reviews have sparked a robust alternative— continuous performance management. I will introduce OKRs’ younger sibling, CFRs (Conversation, Feedback, Recognition), and show how OKRs and CFRs can team up to lift leaders, contributors, and organizations to a whole new level.&#x20;
>
> Continuous Improvement (chapter 17): As a case study for structured goal setting and continuous performance management, we see a robotics-powered pizza company deploys OKRs in every aspect of its operations, from the kitchen to marketing and sales.
>
> &#x20;The Importance of Culture (chapters 18, 19, and 20): Here we’ll explore the impact of OKRs on the workplace, and how they ease and expedite culture change.
